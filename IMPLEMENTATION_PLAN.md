## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence**:

1. **Phase 1 Completion** (P2-P3): Finish documentation and bug fixes
2. **Phase 3 Core** (P2): Log rotation, dry-run, config file support
3. **Phase 4 Testing** (P2): tmux, monitor, status tests
4. **Phase 2 SDK** (P2): Agent SDK integration (can run parallel with Phase 3)
5. **Phase 3 Advanced** (P3): Metrics, notifications, backup
6. **Phase 4 Validation** (P3): CLI, SDK, backward compatibility tests
7. **Phase 5 GitHub** (P4): GitHub issue integration
8. **Phase 6 Sandbox** (P4): Sandbox execution environments
