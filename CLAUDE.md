## Repository Overview

Ralph is an autonomous AI development loop for Claude Code. It repeatedly invokes the Claude Code CLI, tracks progress, detects completion, and manages rate limits and error recovery. The core loop and tooling are **bash/shell**; the optional Agent SDK (`sdk/`) is **Python 3.12+**.

## Architecture

### Main Scripts (root)

- **ralph_loop.sh** (~2300 lines) — Core autonomous loop. Reads instructions, executes Claude Code CLI, tracks progress, evaluates completion, repeats. Manages rate limiting, session continuity, circuit breaker state, live-stream extraction, and pre-analysis output normalization (`ralph_prepare_claude_output_for_analysis (calls ralph_extract_result_from_stream)`).
- **ralph_monitor.sh** — Live tmux dashboard showing loop count, API usage, and recent logs.
- **setup.sh** — Creates new Ralph-managed projects with `.ralph/` directory structure.
- **ralph_import.sh** — Converts PRD/specification documents into Ralph task format using Claude Code CLI with JSON output.
- **ralph_enable.sh** — Interactive wizard to enable Ralph in existing projects. Detects project type, imports tasks from beads/GitHub/PRD sources.
- **ralph_enable_ci.sh** — Non-interactive version of ralph_enable for CI/automation (JSON output, exit codes 0/1/2).
- **create_files.sh** — Bootstrap script that creates the Ralph system files.

### Library Modules (lib/)

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `circuit_breaker.sh` | Simplified three-state pattern (CLOSED/HALF_OPEN/OPEN) — reads state written by `on-stop.sh` hook, handles cooldown/auto-recovery |
| `enable_core.sh` | Shared logic for ralph_enable and ralph_enable_ci (idempotency, detection, template generation) |
| `task_sources.sh` | Task import from beads, GitHub Issues, or PRD documents. Includes deduplication, normalization, per-source/total caps |
| `wizard_utils.sh` | Interactive prompt utilities (confirm, select, text input) |
| `date_utils.sh` | Cross-platform date/epoch utilities |
| `timeout_utils.sh` | Cross-platform timeout command detection (`timeout` on Linux, `gtimeout` on macOS) |
| `metrics.sh` | Lightweight metrics — monthly JSONL in `.ralph/metrics/`, `ralph --stats` summary (Phase 8) |
| `notifications.sh` | Local notifications — terminal, OS native, webhook POST, sound (Phase 8) |
| `backup.sh` | State backup/rollback — auto-snapshots, `ralph --rollback`, max 10 backups (Phase 8) |
| `github_issues.sh` | GitHub Issue integration — import, assess, filter, batch, lifecycle (Phase 10) |
| `sandbox.sh` | Docker sandbox — `ralph --sandbox`, container management, signal forwarding (Phase 11). V2: rootless Docker detection, `--network none` egress control, gVisor runtime support, resource usage reporting (Phase 14) |
| `tracing.sh` | OpenTelemetry traces — GenAI Semantic Conventions, JSONL OTLP format, secret sanitization (Phase 14) |
| `complexity.sh` | Task classification + model routing — Task-type classifier (docs/tools/code/arch) with QA failure escalation. `ralph_classify_task_type` for type-aware routing (Phase 14+), `ralph_select_model` for model selection (type-based + 3-fail opus escalation), per-routing logging to `.model_routing.jsonl` |
| `qa_failures.sh` | QA failure state tracking — persistent per-issue failure counters in `.ralph/.qa_failures.json`. Incremented on QA failure, reset on PASSING. Read by router to escalate to Opus after 3+ consecutive failures on same issue. |
| `memory.sh` | Cross-session memory — episodic (what worked/failed), semantic (project index), decay/pruning (Phase 14) |
| `import_graph.sh` | AST-based file dependency graph — Python `ast`, JS/TS `madge`/grep fallback. Cached in `.ralph/.import_graph.json` with mtime staleness detection. Async background rebuild, incremental invalidation via hooks. (PLANOPT epic) |
| `plan_optimizer.sh` | Fix plan task reordering — parses fix_plan.md, resolves vague tasks via ralph-explorer (Haiku), detects dependencies via import graph + explicit metadata + phase convention, orders via Unix `tsort`, validates semantic equivalence before atomic write. Runs at session start for changed sections only. (PLANOPT epic) |
| `linear_optimizer.sh` | Linear task cache-locality optimizer (LINOPT-2 / TAP-591). `linear_optimizer_run` runs at session start to score open issues. **OAuth-via-MCP is the only supported mode**: Claude picks tasks via the Linear MCP plugin and reports counts in `RALPH_STATUS`; the optimizer is a no-op at the bash layer in this mode. The function exists for future mode where direct issue retrieval is wired through Claude. Guards: `RALPH_NO_LINEAR_OPTIMIZE=true`, missing project config. |
| `linear_backend.sh` | Linear task backend — `linear_get_open_count`, `linear_get_done_count`, `linear_check_configured`. Used when `RALPH_TASK_SOURCE=linear`. **OAuth-via-MCP is the only supported mode**: counts are read from `.ralph/status.json`, written by the on-stop hook from Claude's `RALPH_STATUS` block (TAP-741). Entries older than `RALPH_LINEAR_COUNTS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` (default 900) abstain via the TAP-536 fail-loud path so a stale count cannot trip a false `plan_complete` exit. Iteration 1 has no prior hook write so it abstains (logged INFO, not WARN); iteration 2+ reads fresh counts. Task selection happens entirely via the Linear MCP — Claude lists, picks, and updates issues using `mcp__plugin_linear_linear__*` tools. `linear_check_configured` requires only `RALPH_LINEAR_PROJECT`. |
| `skills_install.sh` | Global Claude skill install/uninstall with `.ralph-managed` sidecar manifest (TAP-574). `skills_install_global` syncs `templates/skills/global/<name>/` into `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` idempotently: fresh dirs get a copy + sha256 manifest; dirs with a matching sidecar refresh only Ralph-owned files and WARN on user-modified ones; dirs without a sidecar are left alone (user-authored). `skills_uninstall_global` is symmetric — removes only files whose current hash matches the manifest, preserving user edits. Sourced by `install.sh` in `main`/`upgrade`/`uninstall` and by `uninstall.sh`. Story 2 (TAP-575) will populate `templates/skills/global/`. |
| `skill_retro.sh` | Skill friction detection and retro apply (SKILLS-INJECT-5/6/7). `skill_retro_detect_friction` reads `status.json` and stream logs after each loop, identifies friction signals (permission denials, repeated stalls, test failures, tool errors), and emits a structured JSON friction report. `skill_retro_apply` acts on the report — advisory mode (`RALPH_SKILL_AUTO_TUNE=false`) logs recommendations; auto-tune mode installs ≤1 skill per call from `~/.claude/skills/`. `skill_retro_periodic_reconcile` re-runs Tier A project detection every N loops (default 10, `RALPH_SKILL_REDETECT_INTERVAL`) and installs newly-applicable skills. |
| ~~`response_analyzer.sh`~~ | Removed — response analysis handled by `on-stop.sh` hook → `status.json` |
| ~~`file_protection.sh`~~ | Removed — file protection handled by PreToolUse hooks |

### SDK (sdk/) — v2.1.0

Python Agent SDK for dual-mode operation. All models are **Pydantic v2 BaseModels**. The agent loop is **fully async** with a `run_sync()` wrapper for CLI. State I/O goes through a **pluggable state backend** (`FileStateBackend` default, `NullStateBackend` for testing/embedding).

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ralph_sdk/agent.py` | Async agent class — RalphAgent, TaskInput (frozen), TaskResult, ProgressSnapshot, CancelResult, DecompositionHint, ContinueAsNewState, run_sync() wrapper. Includes adaptive timeout, completion indicator decay, session lifecycle management. |
| `ralph_sdk/config.py` | Pydantic configuration — validation ranges, .ralphrc/.json/env precedence chain. Includes cost, safety, context, lifecycle, and adaptive timeout settings. |
| `ralph_sdk/status.py` | Pydantic status models — RalphStatus, CircuitBreakerState, WorkType/RalphLoopStatus/ErrorCategory enums |
| `ralph_sdk/state.py` | Pluggable state backend — RalphStateBackend Protocol (18 methods), FileStateBackend (async aiofiles), NullStateBackend (in-memory). Includes session metadata, history, and continue-as-new state. |
| `ralph_sdk/parsing.py` | 3-strategy response parser — JSON fenced block → JSONL result → text fallback. Includes `extract_files_changed()` from tool use records and `detect_permission_denials()`. |
| `ralph_sdk/circuit_breaker.py` | Active circuit breaker — sliding window failure detection, no-progress tracking, cooldown recovery. V2: FastTripDetector, DeferredTestDetector, ConsecutiveTimeoutDetector (Phase 17). |
| `ralph_sdk/context.py` | Context management — ContextManager (progressive fix_plan trimming), PromptParts (stable prefix/dynamic suffix), PromptCacheStats, token estimation (Phase 17). |
| `ralph_sdk/cost.py` | Cost intelligence — CostTracker (per-model pricing, budget alerts), select_model() (complexity-based routing with retry escalation), TokenRateLimiter (hourly window) (Phase 17). |
| `ralph_sdk/metrics.py` | Metrics collection — MetricsCollector Protocol, JsonlMetricsCollector (monthly JSONL), NullMetricsCollector, MetricEvent model (Phase 17). |
| `ralph_sdk/converters.py` | TaskPacket conversion — TaskPacketInput/IntentSpecInput mirror models, complexity→max_turns, trust→permissions |
| `ralph_sdk/evidence.py` | EvidenceBundle output — test/lint extraction (pytest/jest/BATS/ruff/eslint), JSON round-trip |
| `ralph_sdk/tools.py` | Custom tools — ralph_status, ralph_rate_check, ralph_circuit_state, ralph_task_update |
| `ralph_sdk/complexity.py` | 5-level task classifier (TRIVIAL→ARCHITECTURAL) — annotation overrides, keyword scoring, file count, retry escalation. Feeds into `cost.select_model()`. |
| `ralph_sdk/memory.py` | Cross-session episodic + semantic memory — pluggable `MemoryBackend` protocol, keyword retrieval with failure bias, age decay, project index auto-detection. |
| `ralph_sdk/import_graph.py` | AST-based Python + regex JS/TS file dependency graph — `CachedImportGraph` with JSON caching, staleness detection, cross-platform path normalization. |
| `ralph_sdk/plan_optimizer.py` | Fix plan task reordering — 3-layer dependency detection (import graph → metadata → phase), Kahn's toposort, secondary sort (module/phase/size), semantic equivalence validation, atomic write. Auto-runs in `RalphAgent.run()`. |
| `ralph_sdk/versions.py` | Build-time version manifest reader — `get_versions()` returns all component versions from `version.json`. |
| `ralph_sdk/__main__.py` | CLI entry point — `ralph --sdk` or `python -m ralph_sdk` (uses run_sync()) |

### Key Design Patterns

**Dual-condition exit gate**: Loop exit requires BOTH `completion_indicators >= 2` (NLP heuristics) AND Claude's explicit `EXIT_SIGNAL: true` in the RALPH_STATUS block. This prevents premature exits when Claude says "done" mid-phase.

**Pre-flight empty-plan check (PREFLIGHT-EMPTY-PLAN)**: `should_exit_gracefully()` in [ralph_loop.sh:1408](ralph_loop.sh#L1408) runs at the top of every iteration *before* Claude is invoked. When `RALPH_TASK_SOURCE=file`, it greps `fix_plan.md` for unchecked `- [ ]` items; if zero, it short-circuits with `plan_complete` and exits cleanly — no Claude call is made. Same logic applies to the Linear branch via `linear_get_open_count` (with TAP-536 fail-loud: API errors **abstain** rather than treat unknown as zero, so a transient outage cannot trip a false `plan_complete`). Without this check, an empty plan cost 3 wasted Claude calls per launch before the no-progress CB tripped with a misleading `stagnation_detected` reason. Both `grep -c` reads in this function are sanitized via `tr -cd '0-9'` to neutralize the `grep -c | echo "0"` pitfall (see EXIT-CLEAN below).

**EXIT-CLEAN branch in `on-stop.sh` (templates/hooks/on-stop.sh)**: A 4th branch in the CB-update logic — between `has_permission_denials` and the no-progress fallback — recognizes `EXIT_SIGNAL: true && STATUS: COMPLETE` as a *clean* exit signal even when `files_modified=0` and `tasks_completed=0`. Without it, an end-of-campaign loop where Claude correctly reports "all done, exit" still gets classified as no-progress (because no files changed) and counts toward the CB threshold, so consecutive empty loops trip the breaker on the same signal Claude is using to ask for shutdown. Defense in depth for cases the pre-flight check can't catch (e.g., the last task in a plan is completed *during* a Claude invocation, leaving the plan empty by the next iteration).

**`grep -c | echo "0"` pitfall in shell hooks**: `grep -c PATTERN <<< "text"` exits 1 with stdout `"0"` when there's no match, so the idiom `count=$(grep -c PAT 2>/dev/null || echo "0")` produces `"0\n0"` — two zeros — which then crashes bash arithmetic AND injects a stray `0\n` into any heredoc that interpolates the value. In `on-stop.sh` this corrupted `status.json` (`"permission_denial_count": 0\n0`), causing every downstream `jq` read in `ralph_loop.sh` to fall back to defaults (`exit_signal` silently became `"false"`, `.exit_signals.completion_indicators` never grew, dual-condition gate never fired). Fix: pipe through `tr -cd '0-9'` and apply `${var:-0}` before any arithmetic. The template hook has this fix; older project hooks need `ralph-upgrade` to sync.

**Four-layer API limit detection**: (1) Timeout guard (exit code 124), (2) Structural JSON `rate_limit_event` parsing, (3) Filtered text fallback on last 30 lines, (4) Extra Usage quota detection. Layers 3-4 filter out echoed project file content to avoid false positives.

**Circuit breaker auto-recovery**: OPEN state is not terminal — after a cooldown period (default 30 min) it transitions to HALF_OPEN, then back to CLOSED on progress. `CB_AUTO_RESET=true` bypasses cooldown for unattended operation.

**Session continuity**: Claude session IDs persist in `.ralph/.claude_session_id` with 24-hour expiration. Sessions auto-reset on circuit breaker open, manual interrupt, or `is_error: true` API responses.

**File protection**: Two layers — (1) the agent file `.claude/agents/ralph.md` `disallowedTools:` blocklist prevents destructive bash patterns and `tools:` allowlists the surface; (2) PreToolUse hooks (`protect-ralph-files.sh`, `validate-command.sh`) block modifications to `.ralph/`, `.claude/`, and `.ralphrc` in real-time and hard-block destructive patterns (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, `git rm`) regardless of agent config. The historical `ALLOWED_TOOLS` allowlist in `.ralphrc` was removed with legacy `-p` mode — see [docs/decisions/0006-delete-legacy-mode.md](docs/decisions/0006-delete-legacy-mode.md) and [MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md).

**Hook-based response analysis**: The `on-stop.sh` hook runs after every Claude response, extracts RALPH_STATUS fields (auto-unescaping JSON-encoded `\n` from JSONL stream output), writes `status.json`, and updates circuit breaker state. The loop reads from `status.json` instead of parsing raw CLI output. The hook includes a text fallback when no JSON path matches the response payload, and infers `WORK_TYPE: IMPLEMENTATION` when files are modified but the field is UNKNOWN. Atomic writes use `rm -f` after `mv` to prevent orphaned temp files on WSL/NTFS.

**Log rotation**: `rotate_ralph_log()` rotates `ralph.log` when it exceeds `LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB` (default 10). `cleanup_old_output_logs()` prunes old `claude_output_*.log` files beyond `LOG_MAX_OUTPUT_FILES` (default 20). Both run at startup and every loop iteration.

**Dry-run mode**: `--dry-run` or `DRY_RUN=true` simulates a loop iteration without calling the Claude API. Writes a `status.json` with `status: "DRY_RUN"` and exits after one iteration. Useful for validating configuration and tool permissions.

**WSL/Windows version divergence detection**: `check_version_divergence()` runs at startup in WSL environments. Compares `RALPH_VERSION` between `~/.ralph/ralph_loop.sh` (WSL) and `/mnt/c/Users/*/.ralph/ralph_loop.sh` (Windows). Warns if versions differ and detects stale `response_analyzer.sh` files.

**WSL PowerShell auto-patching (XPLAT-2b)**: `ralph_validate_hooks()` now also inspects the target project's `.claude/settings.json` for hooks calling bare `powershell` (which is unavailable in WSL — requires `powershell.exe`). When detected, Ralph auto-patches the settings file in-place via `sed`, skipping lines that already use `powershell.exe`. This prevents session-start hook errors when running Ralph against Windows-native projects from WSL.

**Atomic state writes + pipefail (TAP-535)**: All counter / state-file writes (`CALL_COUNT_FILE`, `TOKEN_COUNT_FILE`, `TIMESTAMP_FILE`, `persistent_loop_file`) go through the `atomic_write <file> <value>` helper near the top of `ralph_loop.sh`. The helper writes to a unique temp path (`${file}.tmp.$$.${RANDOM}`), best-effort fsyncs, then `mv -f`s into place — so a SIGTERM landing between truncate and write can no longer leave a zero-byte counter that silently defaults to 0 on the next read. The script also enables `set -o pipefail` after library sourcing so jq/grep pipelines don't silently mask broken inputs, and rejects Bash < 4 at startup.

**Hook resilience + drift detection (TAP-538)**: `templates/hooks/on-stop.sh` self-heals a corrupt `.circuit_breaker_state`: if `jq -e 'type == "object"'` fails on the current state file, the hook re-initializes it to `{state:CLOSED, consecutive_no_progress:0, ...}` and emits a single `WARN: .circuit_breaker_state is corrupt — reinitializing to CLOSED` line on stderr instead of crashing the loop. `templates/hooks/` is the source of truth for project hooks; `ralph-doctor` now compares each project's `.ralph/hooks/*.sh` against `~/.ralph/templates/hooks/*.sh` and warns on drift (re-run `ralph-upgrade` to sync). The repo's own `.ralph/hooks/*.sh` is kept byte-identical to the template; a unit test enforces this so the runtime copy cannot quietly diverge again.

**MCP server process cleanup (MCP-CLEANUP)**: Claude Code spawns MCP servers (tapps-mcp, docsmcp via `uv`) as grandchild processes. On Windows, these survive after the CLI exits because process group teardown doesn't cascade — each loop iteration leaks one `uv` + `python` pair per MCP server. `ralph_cleanup_orphaned_mcp()` runs after every CLI invocation and in the exit trap, killing only **orphaned** MCP processes (parent process dead) to avoid disrupting MCP servers belonging to the user's editor (Cursor, VS Code). On Windows/MINGW it uses a temp PowerShell script with `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` + parent-alive check (10s timeout guard); on Linux/macOS/WSL it uses `pgrep`/`kill` filtering by PPID==1. `tapps-brain` is intentionally excluded from the cleanup regex — it runs as a dockerized HTTP MCP server with its own container lifecycle.

**MCP probe + prompt guidance (TAP-583 / TAP-585)**: Ralph probes three MCP servers at startup via `ralph_probe_mcp_servers()` — **docs-mcp**, **tapps-mcp**, and **tapps-brain** — setting `RALPH_MCP_{DOCS,TAPPS,BRAIN}_AVAILABLE`. `build_loop_context()` injects a short "when to use" block per server into `--append-system-prompt` so Claude actually reaches for the MCP tools instead of falling back to Read/Grep/Bash. **Each MCP is registered by the project** (via `.mcp.json` or `claude mcp add`), never by Ralph — if a server is not registered, the probe fails and the guidance block is omitted. Gating rules: **docs-mcp** is injected only when the current task looks docs-related (`ralph_task_is_docs_related` scans the next unchecked task / Linear issue for README/ADR/architecture/changelog/`.md` keywords, fail-closed on empty or missing); **tapps-mcp** and **tapps-brain** are injected unconditionally when their servers are reachable because their recommended tools (`tapps_quality_gate`, `tapps_lookup_docs`, `brain_recall`) apply across task types. Run `ralph --mcp-status` to see which probes succeeded without grepping logs.

**Sub-agents**: Four specialized agents keep search, testing, review, and complex architecture work out of the main context:
- **ralph-explorer** (Haiku) — fast codebase search
- **ralph-tester** (Sonnet, worktree-isolated) — test runner
- **ralph-reviewer** (Sonnet, read-only) — code review
- **ralph-architect** (Opus) — complex/architectural tasks with mandatory code review

The main Ralph agent (Sonnet) handles routine work with task batching (up to 5 small / 3 medium tasks per invocation) and delegates LARGE tasks to ralph-architect.

**Speed optimizations** (v1.8.4+): The main ralph agent runs on Sonnet with `bypassPermissions` mode and `effort: medium` for faster throughput. PostToolUse hooks (`on-file-change.sh`, `on-bash-command.sh`) are disabled to reduce per-tool-call overhead. Safety is maintained via PreToolUse hooks (file protection, command validation) and the `disallowedTools` list.

**Epic-boundary deferral** (v1.8.5): Multiple expensive operations are deferred until epic boundaries — the completion of the last `- [ ]` task under a `##` section in fix_plan.md:
- **QA**: ralph-tester and ralph-reviewer skipped mid-epic (set `TESTS_STATUS: DEFERRED`). Mandatory before `EXIT_SIGNAL: true` and for LARGE tasks.
- **Explorer**: ralph-explorer skipped for consecutive SMALL tasks in the same module. Use Glob/Grep directly instead.
- **Backups**: State snapshots deferred to epic boundaries instead of every loop.
- **Batch sizes**: Increased to 8 SMALL / 5 MEDIUM (safe because QA catches regressions at boundaries).
- **Subprocess batching**: on-stop.sh, exit signal updates, status reads, and JSON config loading all use single jq calls instead of multiple spawns (reduced from ~50 to ~10 jq calls per loop).
- **Version caching**: Claude CLI version checked once at startup instead of 4 times.
- **Inter-loop pause**: Reduced from 5s to 2s.
- **Log rotation**: Every 10 loops instead of every loop.

**Live / JSONL pipeline**: `--live` captures NDJSON via an `awk` stream filter that shows tool names with parameters (file paths, commands, patterns), per-tool elapsed time, sub-agent events, error messages (extracted from `result`/`content` fields on `is_error:true`, truncated to 120 chars), and a summary stats line. Claude's text output is buffered per content block and filtered at block boundaries: text containing stream metadata (`session_id`, `parent_tool_use_id`, `uuid`), raw JSON dumps, or UUID patterns is suppressed; remaining text is collapsed to a single line, truncated to 200 chars, and shown with `>` prefix. JSON string value extraction uses a placeholder technique (`\001`) to protect escaped quotes before finding the closing quote. The loop copies the full stream, retries `-f` on the output file (WSL2/9P), extracts the last `type: "result"` line when `CLAUDE_USE_CONTINUE` is true, then `ralph_prepare_claude_output_for_analysis` logs permission denials and failed MCP init, and `ralph_extract_result_from_stream` isolates the result object from the JSONL stream (filtering subagent results from the multi-result count).

**Continue-As-New (CTXMGMT-3)**: Temporal-inspired pattern for long sessions. After `RALPH_MAX_SESSION_ITERATIONS` (default 20) or `RALPH_MAX_SESSION_AGE_MINUTES` (default 120), the session resets while carrying forward essential state (current task, progress, recommendation). Controlled by `RALPH_CONTINUE_AS_NEW_ENABLED` (default true). Research shows agent success rate drops after ~35 min. The SDK implements the same pattern via `ContinueAsNewState` in `agent.py`.

**Completion indicator decay (SDK-SAFETY-3)**: When productive work occurs (files_modified > 0 or tasks_completed > 0) AND exit_signal is false, completion_indicators are reset to `[]`. This prevents stale "done" signals from combining with later legitimate signals for premature exit.

**Agent evaluation framework (EVALS)**: Golden-file test infrastructure in `tests/evals/`. Deterministic suite (64 BATS tests, no LLM calls, <5 min) verifies exit gate, circuit breaker, tool restrictions, and hooks. Stochastic suite runs N golden-file comparisons with three-valued outcomes (Pass/Fail/Inconclusive) and Wilson score confidence intervals for nightly CI.

**Linear task backend (`RALPH_TASK_SOURCE=linear`)**: When set, Ralph replaces all `fix_plan.md` reads with Linear via the Linear MCP plugin. **OAuth-via-MCP is the only supported mode** — there is no harness-side API key. Claude lists, picks, and updates Linear issues using `mcp__plugin_linear_linear__*` tools; the harness reads counts from `.ralph/status.json` written by the on-stop hook from Claude's `RALPH_STATUS` block. Five integration points in `ralph_loop.sh` branch on this variable: exit-condition check, dry-run status display, `build_loop_context()` (injects next issue + Linear MCP instructions into `--append-system-prompt`), `ralph_continue_as_new()` (saves open/done counts), and startup pre-seeding of exit signals. The backend is sourced from `lib/linear_backend.sh` at startup. Requires `RALPH_LINEAR_PROJECT` (exact project name in Linear). The full state-transition rules (what moves where, who moves it, the hard rule that Done requires commits on `main`) are documented in **[docs/LINEAR-WORKFLOW.md](docs/LINEAR-WORKFLOW.md)**; this is the shared workflow for every Ralph-managed project in the `TappsCodingAgents` team. **TAP-536 fail-loud handling**: each integration point distinguishes "exit non-zero" (count unknown — stale or no hook write yet) from "exit 0 + value" (real result). The exit-condition check **skips the gate entirely** on a failure so a stale count cannot trip `plan_complete`. `build_loop_context()` injects "Remaining tasks (Linear): unknown (counts not yet reported — do NOT emit EXIT_SIGNAL)" so Claude does not emit a stale done signal.

**Linear cache-locality optimizer (LINOPT epic)**: At session start, `linear_optimizer_run()` runs as a background job (fire-and-forget). It fetches the top-N open issues, extracts likely file paths from issue bodies via regex, falls back to ralph-explorer (Haiku, capped at 3 calls/session) for top-3 priority issues with no body paths, and scores each candidate with `Jaccard(last_completed_files, candidate_files) + 0.3 * shared_dir_bonus`. The highest scorer's identifier is atomically written to `.ralph/.linear_next_issue`. `build_loop_context()` reads this file on the next loop and injects `LOCALITY HINT: <ID>` into the system prompt; the ralph-workflow skill (step 0) tells Claude to prefer the hint if the issue is still open, then delete the file. This compresses context-switch cost by keeping Claude in the same module across consecutive loops. The `on-stop.sh` hook (TAP-590 / LINOPT-1) is the data source: it walks the JSONL session transcript after each loop to extract edited file paths → `.ralph/.last_completed_files`.

**Design documentation**: Reliability epics and stories live in **`docs/specs/`** (e.g. `epic-jsonl-stream-resilience.md`, `epic-multi-task-cascading-failures.md`). Long-term platform integration is drafted in `docs/specs/claude-code-2026-enhancements.md`.

### State Files (in `.ralph/` within managed projects)

- `.call_count` / `.last_reset` — Rate limit tracking (hourly reset)
- `.exit_signals` — Exit signal history
- `status.json` — Real-time status and response analysis (written by on-stop.sh hook)
- `.circuit_breaker_state` — Circuit breaker state (JSON)
- `.claude_session_id` — Session persistence
- `PROMPT.md` — Main development instructions driving each loop
- `fix_plan.md` — Prioritized task list
- `AGENT.md` — Build/run instructions
- `.last_completed_files` — One repo-relative file path per line, written by `on-stop.sh` after each loop (LINOPT-1 / TAP-590). Read by `linear_optimizer.sh` to score issue locality.
- `.linear_next_issue` — Single line: Linear issue identifier (e.g. `TAP-591`) written atomically by `linear_optimizer_run` at session start. Consumed by `build_loop_context()` as `LOCALITY HINT`; deleted by Claude after honoring.
- `.linear_optimizer_cache.json` — Explorer-fallback path cache keyed by `issue_id:updatedAt`. Prevents re-paying the Haiku cost for the same issue across sessions.

### Configuration

Project-level config lives in `.ralphrc` (sourced as bash). Key variables:
- `CLAUDE_CODE_CMD` — CLI command (default: `"claude"`, fallback: `"npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code"`)
- `CLAUDE_OUTPUT_FORMAT` — `json` (default) or `text`
- `CLAUDE_MODEL` — Model override (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`); falls through to the agent file's `model:` directive when unset
- `RALPH_AGENT_NAME` — Agent file basename (default: `"ralph"`, resolves to `.claude/agents/ralph.md`)
- `CLAUDE_USE_CONTINUE` — Session continuity toggle
- `CLAUDE_AUTO_UPDATE` — Auto-update CLI at startup (disable for Docker/air-gapped)
- `CB_COOLDOWN_MINUTES`, `CB_AUTO_RESET` — Circuit breaker recovery config
- `LOG_MAX_SIZE_MB` — Max ralph.log size before rotation (default: 10)
- `LOG_MAX_FILES` — Number of rotated log files to keep (default: 5)
- `LOG_MAX_OUTPUT_FILES` — Max claude_output_*.log files to keep (default: 20)
- `DRY_RUN` — Preview loop execution without API calls (also `--dry-run` flag)
- `RALPH_TASK_SOURCE` — Task backend: `"file"` (default, reads `fix_plan.md`) or `"linear"` (Claude picks via the Linear MCP, OAuth-via-MCP only)
- `RALPH_LINEAR_PROJECT` — Linear project name, must exactly match workspace (required when `RALPH_TASK_SOURCE=linear`)
- `RALPH_NO_OPTIMIZE` — Disable automatic fix_plan.md reordering on session start
- `RALPH_NO_EXPLORER_RESOLVE` — Disable ralph-explorer file resolution for vague tasks
- `RALPH_MAX_EXPLORER_RESOLVE` — Max vague tasks to resolve per optimization run (default: 5)
- `RALPH_NO_LINEAR_OPTIMIZE` — Disable Linear cache-locality optimizer entirely (no API calls, no hint file written)
- `RALPH_OPTIMIZER_FETCH_LIMIT` — Max issues to fetch and score per optimizer run (default: 20)
- `RALPH_OPTIMIZER_EXPLORER_MAX` — Max ralph-explorer calls per optimizer session (default: 3)
- `RALPH_MCP_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` — Upper bound on the startup `claude mcp list` probe (default: 30). High default covers cold-start cases where stdio MCP servers spawn child processes and HTTP MCPs do auth round-trips. Warm runs return in 1–2s so the cap is invisible.
- `RALPH_MODEL_ROUTING_ENABLED` — Per-task type + QA escalation → model routing (default: `true`). When enabled, `build_claude_command` classifies the next task via `ralph_classify_task_type` (docs/tools/code/arch) and calls `ralph_select_model` with the QA failure count (from `.ralph/.qa_failures.json` for the current Linear issue). Routing: docs/tools → `haiku` (~1/5 cost), code → `sonnet` (floor), arch → `opus`, QA failures ≥3 → `opus` (safety escalation). Task text comes from the next Linear issue (or in-progress one if present) or first unchecked `fix_plan.md` line; routing decisions append to `.ralph/.model_routing.jsonl` (includes `task_type` and `reason` fields). Falls back to `CLAUDE_MODEL` when task text is empty. Old complexity-band variables (`RALPH_MODEL_TRIVIAL`, etc.) are deprecated but still recognized for backwards compatibility.
- `RALPH_SKILL_AUTO_TUNE` — When `true`, `skill_retro_apply` installs up to 1 recommended skill per loop automatically (default: `false`)
- `RALPH_SKILL_RETRO_WINDOW` — Number of recent loops to examine for friction patterns (default: 5)
- `RALPH_SKILL_REDETECT_INTERVAL` — Run periodic Tier A skill re-detection every N loops (default: 10)

Environment variables override `.ralphrc` settings.

## Observability: Task-Type Routing & QA Escalation

### Model Routing Decisions (.model_routing.jsonl)

When `RALPH_MODEL_ROUTING_ENABLED=true`, every loop appends a JSON line to `.ralph/.model_routing.jsonl` describing the routing decision:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-04-30T14:23:45Z","task_type":"code","model":"sonnet","retry_count":0,"reason":"type_code"}
{"timestamp":"2026-04-30T14:24:12Z","task_type":"docs","model":"haiku","retry_count":0,"reason":"type_haiku"}
{"timestamp":"2026-04-30T14:25:30Z","task_type":"code","model":"opus","retry_count":3,"reason":"qa_failure_escalation"}
```

**Fields**:
- `timestamp`: ISO-8601 time of routing decision
- `task_type`: `docs`, `tools`, `code`, or `arch`
- `model`: Selected model (`haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`)
- `retry_count`: QA failure count for the current issue (0–N)
- `reason`: Routing signal (`type_haiku`, `type_code`, `type_arch`, `qa_failure_escalation`)

**Observability queries**:

```bash
# Count routing decisions by type and model
jq -s 'group_by(.task_type) | map({type: .[0].task_type, count: length, models: (map(.model) | unique)})' .ralph/.model_routing.jsonl

# Find all QA escalations (retry_count >= 3)
jq 'select(.retry_count >= 3)' .ralph/.model_routing.jsonl

# Average model cost per task type (rough estimate: haiku~1, sonnet~3, opus~5)
jq -s 'group_by(.task_type) | map({type: .[0].task_type, avg_cost: (map({haiku:1, sonnet:3, opus:5}[.model]) | add / length)})' .ralph/.model_routing.jsonl

# Check for stuck tasks (same issue failing QA repeatedly)
jq 'select(.reason == "qa_failure_escalation") | {task_type, retry_count, timestamp}' .ralph/.model_routing.jsonl
```

### QA Failure State (.qa_failures.json)

Tracks consecutive QA failures per Linear issue:

```json
{"TAP-123": 2, "TAP-456": 1}
```

**Query**: Check current failure count for an issue:

```bash
jq '.["TAP-123"]' .ralph/.qa_failures.json
```

The count increments on QA failure (called by on-stop hook), resets on PASSING (via `qa_failures_reset`), and triggers Opus escalation at count ≥3.

## Testing

- **Framework**: BATS (Bash Automated Testing System) with bats-assert and bats-support
- **Prerequisites**: Node.js 18+, jq, git, gawk (mawk lacks `match(s, re, arr)` array capture used by PLANOPT-2)
- **Quality gate**: 100% test pass rate (code coverage via kcov is informational only due to subprocess tracing limitations)
- Tests live in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`; helpers in `tests/helpers/`
- **Agent evals**: `tests/evals/deterministic/` (64 BATS tests, no LLM calls) and `tests/evals/stochastic/` (golden-file comparisons with Wilson score CI). Run via `npm run test:evals:deterministic` and `npm run test:evals:stochastic`.

### CI: blocking vs informational (TAP-537)

The `Test Suite` workflow in `.github/workflows/test.yml` has two job categories. Only the **blocking** ones gate merges. **Informational** ones must still surface failure signal — never silence with bare `|| true`:

| Step | Status | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| `npm run test:unit` | **blocking** | Core invariants — every PR must keep these green |
| `npm run test:integration` | **blocking** | Was masked with `|| true`; mask hid real regressions for multiple releases (stale version assertion, missing exec bit on `tests/mock_claude.sh`, missing `ralph_upgrade_project.sh` test fixture). Now hard-fails. |
| `npm run test:evals:deterministic` | **blocking** | 64 deterministic checks of loop-correctness invariants (exit gate, circuit breaker, tool restrictions, hooks). No LLM cost. |
| `kcov` coverage steps | informational | Subprocess tracing is structurally incomplete in BATS-spawned bash. We keep it running but log stderr to `coverage/<label>.stderr.log` and emit a `::warning::` annotation instead of swallowing the exit code with `|| true`. |
| `npm run test:evals:stochastic` | informational | Runs N golden-file comparisons against live LLM; intended for nightly/manual jobs, not PR gating. |

When adding a new CI step, decide its category up front. If informational, capture stderr to an artifact + emit a GitHub annotation rather than `|| true` — silent masking is what TAP-537 rolled back.

## Versioning

The version string exists in **two** files that **must stay in sync**:

| File | Location | Format |
|------|----------|--------|
| `package.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` | npm standard |
| `ralph_loop.sh` | `RALPH_VERSION="X.Y.Z"` (near top of file) | bash variable, powers `ralph --version` / `ralph -V` |

**When bumping the version** (release, build, or deploy), update **both** files to the same value. A mismatch means `ralph --version` will report a different version than `npm version` / `package.json`.

## Development Standards

- **Conventional commits**: `feat(module):`, `fix(module):`, `test(module):`, etc.
- **Branch naming**: `feature/<name>`, `fix/<name>`, `docs/<name>`
- All features must have passing tests, be committed and pushed, and have fix_plan.md updated
- Update this CLAUDE.md when introducing new patterns or changing loop behavior
- Keep template files in `templates/` synchronized with implementation changes

## Global Installation Layout

- **Commands** (`~/.local/bin/`): `ralph`, `ralph-monitor`, `ralph-setup`, `ralph-import`, `ralph-migrate`, `ralph-enable`, `ralph-enable-ci`, `ralph-sdk`, `ralph-doctor`, `ralph-upgrade`
- **Scripts and libs** (`~/.ralph/`): Main scripts + `lib/` modules
- **Templates** (`~/.ralph/templates/`): Project scaffolding templates
- **Global Claude skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`): Tier S baseline synced from `templates/skills/global/` at install/upgrade time via `lib/skills_install.sh`. Ralph-installed skill dirs carry a `.ralph-managed` sidecar; user-authored skills or user-modified files are never touched (TAP-574). The canonical library is maintained in-repo under `templates/skills/global/<name>/` with `SKILL.md` + `examples/` — currently 5 Tier S skills (`search-first`, `tdd-workflow`, `simplify`, `context-audit`, `agentic-engineering`), each enforced by `tests/unit/test_skill_frontmatter.bats` + `test_skill_content.bats` (TAP-575).

## Karpathy Behavioral Guidelines

> Source: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills @ c9a44ae835fa2f5765a697216692705761a53f40 (MIT)
> Derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls.

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
